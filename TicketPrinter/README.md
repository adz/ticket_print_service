Ticket Printer
==============
A pure java codebase that can return the installed printers, and print simple tickets.

Should be no special requirements other than Java 1.6 + -- no dependent
jars or anything....

I used Netbeans to build it, which generates `./build/**/*.class` and
`./dist/JavaTicketPrinter.jar`
